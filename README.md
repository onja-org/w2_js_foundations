# JavaScript Foundations Lab

Welcome to the JavaScript Foundations Lab! This comprehensive lab takes you from setting up your development environment to building interactive webpages with JavaScript.

## 🎯 Overview

This lab introduces you to the fundamentals of JavaScript programming, covering both server-side (Node.js) and client-side (browser) development. You'll learn to work with JavaScript's core concepts while building practical, real-world projects.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand your JavaScript development environment (Node.js, npm, VS Code)
- Write and run JavaScript programs on your computer
- Master JavaScript's core data types and operators
- Use the browser console for development and debugging
- Build interactive webpages with JavaScript
- Understand how JavaScript works in different environments

## 🏗️ Lab Structure

This lab consists of four interconnected parts, designed to be completed in sequence:

### [Part 1: Setting Up Your JavaScript Development Environment](./lab/01_environment_setup.md)
**Time: 1 hour**
- Understand the tools that power JavaScript development
- Set up your workspace with proper organization
- Learn about terminals, shells, and development workflow
- Connect the tools you've been using to their underlying purpose

### [Part 2: Introduction to JavaScript Scripting](./lab/02_js_scripting.md)
**Time: 1.5 hours**
- Explore JavaScript interactively with the Node.js REPL
- Write your first real JavaScript programs
- Build a fictional character profile generator
- Create a smart calculator with conditional logic
- Understand how Node.js runs JavaScript on your computer

### [Part 3: JavaScript Data Types and Operators](./lab/03_data_types_operators.md)
**Time: 1.5 hours**
- Master JavaScript's core data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Learn essential operators for manipulation and comparison
- Preview more powerful data structures (arrays, functions, objects)
- Debug common type-related errors through hands-on exercises
- Prepare for future learning with TypeScript concepts

### [Part 4: JavaScript Console - Your Browser's Programming Environment](./lab/04_js_console.md)
**Time: 1.5 hours**
- Use the browser console as a JavaScript playground
- Manipulate webpages live using JavaScript
- Build an interactive character creator webpage
- Understand the connection between webpage JavaScript and console
- Master the browser development workflow

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine in `~/development/labs/` (or your preferred directory) using:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-url>
   ```
3. **Start with Part 1** and work through each section in order
4. **Complete all activities** and save your work in the appropriate files
5. **Test everything** to make sure it works as expected

## 📁 Expected File Structure

After completing all parts, your lab folder should contain:

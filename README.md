# JavaScript Foundations Lab - Wave 2

Welcome to your first comprehensive JavaScript learning experience! This lab takes you from setting up your development environment to building interactive webpages with JavaScript.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand your JavaScript development environment (Node.js, npm, VS Code)
- Write and run JavaScript programs on your computer
- Master JavaScript's core data types and operators
- Use the browser console for development and debugging
- Build interactive webpages with JavaScript
- Understand how JavaScript works in different environments

## 📚 Lab Structure

This lab consists of four interconnected parts, designed to be completed in sequence:

### [Part 1: Setting Up Your JavaScript Development Environment](./01_environment_setup.md)
**Time: 1 hour**
- Understand the tools that power JavaScript development
- Set up your workspace with proper organization
- Learn about terminals, shells, and development workflow
- Connect the tools you've been using to their underlying purpose

### [Part 2: Introduction to JavaScript Scripting](./02_js_scripting.md)
**Time: 1.5 hours**
- Explore JavaScript interactively with the Node.js REPL
- Write your first real JavaScript programs
- Build a fictional character profile generator
- Create a smart calculator with conditional logic
- Understand how Node.js runs JavaScript on your computer

### [Part 3: JavaScript Data Types and Operators](./03_data_types_operators.md)
**Time: 1.5 hours**
- Master JavaScript's core data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Learn essential operators for manipulation and comparison
- Preview more powerful data structures (arrays, functions, objects)
- Debug common type-related errors through hands-on exercises
- Prepare for future learning with TypeScript concepts

### [Part 4: JavaScript Console - Your Browser's Programming Environment](./04_js_console.md)
**Time: 1.5 hours**
- Use the browser console as a JavaScript playground
- Manipulate webpages live using JavaScript
- Build an interactive character creator webpage
- Understand the connection between webpage JavaScript and console
- Master the browser development workflow

## 🛠 What You'll Build

Throughout this lab, you'll create several practical projects:

1. **Personal workspace setup** with organized folders for all your coding work
2. **Character profile script** that demonstrates variables, calculations, and output
3. **Smart calculator** with conditional logic and user-friendly responses
4. **Type debugging exercises** that teach you to identify and fix common errors
5. **Interactive character creator webpage** that responds to user clicks and input

All of these projects will be saved in your lab folder and committed to your repository.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine in `~/development/labs/`
3. **Start with Part 1** and work through each section in order
4. **Complete all activities** and save your work in the appropriate files
5. **Test everything** to make sure it works as expected

## 📁 Expected File Structure

After completing all parts, your lab folder should contain:

```
w2_js_foundations/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── 01_environment_setup.md      # Environment setup guide
├── 02_js_scripting.md          # JavaScript scripting tutorial
├── 03_data_types_operators.md  # Data types and operators lesson
├── 04_js_console.md            # Browser console guide
├── character-profile.js        # From Part 2
├── smart-calculator.js         # From Part 2
├── type-confusion-bugs.js      # From Part 3 (with your fixes)
└── character-creator.html      # From Part 4
```

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

This lab follows Onja's principle of **understanding through exploration** rather than rote memorization. You'll:

- **Discover concepts** through hands-on experimentation
- **Build real projects** that demonstrate your learning
- **Connect ideas** across different programming environments
- **Develop debugging skills** through practical problem-solving
- **Prepare for future learning** with solid foundational concepts

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

- **VS Code** (text editor)
- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime for your computer)
- **npm** (package manager, comes with Node.js)
- **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- **Terminal/Command line** access

*Don't worry if you don't have these yet - Part 1 will guide you through installation and setup!*

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Type code by hand** when possible - it helps with learning and muscle memory
2. **Experiment freely** - the REPL and console are safe spaces to try things
3. **Read error messages** - they're trying to help you understand what went wrong
4. **Use `console.log()`** liberally to understand what your code is doing
5. **Take breaks** - programming concepts need time to sink in
6. **Ask questions** - if something doesn't make sense, explore it further

## 🌟 Beyond This Lab

This lab prepares you for upcoming topics including:
- **Data structures** (arrays and objects in depth)
- **Functions and scope** (building reusable, modular code)
- **DOM manipulation** (making webpages interactive)
- **Algorithms** (problem-solving with code)
- **TypeScript** (type-safe JavaScript for larger applications)

## 📝 Committing Your Work

After completing all four parts:

1. **Check your work**: Make sure all files are saved and programs run correctly
2. **Add files to git**: `git add .`
3. **Commit your changes**: `git commit -m "Complete JavaScript Foundations lab"`
4. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin main`

Your completed lab will serve as:
- **Portfolio evidence** of your JavaScript foundations
- **Reference material** for future projects
- **Progress marker** in your development journey
